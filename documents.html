        <p> The Research Methods and Professional Practice module significantly broadened my understanding of research, particularly in cybersecurity,</br> by introducing both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. I learned to critically analyze and select appropriate methods based on research objectives, and I overcame initial challenges with statistical analysis, gaining confidence in techniques like hypothesis testing. The module emphasized ethical, social, and legal considerations, especially in relation to data privacy, and the use of an e-portfolio allowed me to document my progress and reflect on my growth as a researcher, preparing me for future professional challenges.
